First of all, Hi there - my name is Levi. I'm not going to do much in the way of introduction, because really - I don't think any of you care. To keep it short and simple - I'm relatively new in Cyber Security, but have over a decade of Information Technology experience. Do you have any reason to follow my content? Eh, probably not - but what I lack in experience I can make up for with my personal...experience. My own personal take on things.

Whenever I am thinking about something, or approaching a new problem, or even some sitations; I will often start out by 'googling' whatever the thing is I'm looking doing or looking to do. There's probably some folks out there that think thats a cop out, but listen - I have limited brain power and the internet is a wealth of knowledge. Some of it good, most of it bad, either way it often provides a launching point for me. With the advent of Large Language Models like ChatGPT or CoPilot, I've shifted to asking these initial questions to AI - just to see what type of answer I get. Its kind of illuminating actually.

So the idea or question on that came up the other day was "why should I have a personal brand?" I was chatting with some work collegues and it was revealed that a manager in a different department, as well as several of my direct co-workers maintain a blog or website of some sort - and so I asked..."Whats the point of posting or even having a 'brand' to begin with?" I received varying degrees of answers, but the primary one I noticed was "Its good for credibility."

Now, I imagine that there are some reactions that were similar to mine, but I decided to at least check this out. So guess what I did? I threw that question into ChatGPT. The response was extensive, so I won't share it all, but the top 3 are listed below. Personally, I agree with 1 and 3, but I'm not really aiming to have success in the 2nd option (I have other websites that can do that.) For a first post, I think I'll keep this short. If ChatGPT has any validity in its answer(s) - I stand to benefit from continuing this process.

Running your own website as a cybersecurity professional can be a significant asset in building and maintaining your personal brand. Hereâ€™s why:

### **1. Establishing Authority and Credibility**
   - **Showcasing Expertise**: Your website is a platform to demonstrate your knowledge and skills in cybersecurity. By sharing blog posts, articles, tutorials, or case studies, you can establish yourself as an authority in the field.
   - **Portfolio of Work**: You can showcase your previous projects, certifications, and accomplishments, which helps potential clients or employers see your capabilities at a glance.

### **2. Building Trust**
   - **Professional Presence**: A well-designed, professional website builds trust with potential clients, employers, and collaborators. It shows that you take your profession seriously and are committed to maintaining a high standard.
   - **Client Testimonials and Case Studies**: Including testimonials and detailed case studies can provide social proof, which is crucial in a field where trust and reliability are paramount.

### **3. Networking and Opportunities**
   - **Attracting Opportunities**: Your website can serve as a hub for networking, allowing others in the cybersecurity field to find you, connect, and potentially collaborate on projects.
   - **Speaking Engagements and Writing**: As your website gains traffic, it could lead to invitations for speaking engagements, guest posts, or collaborations, further enhancing your visibility and credibility.
