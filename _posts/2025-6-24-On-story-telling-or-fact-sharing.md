## Late Night Musings

I always find myself doing these things late at night. Maybe its because my 9-5 and 5-9 and 9-midnight blend in, or maybe its my ADHD and now is my prime thinking time (Ok, no) or...maybe its just because the world feels quieter after the sun goes down...sometimes I find myself wondering if the tone of these would change if I would write them during the day time. But anyways, its quiet now, and I just spent 20 minutes looking for my daughters paci, so here is a story.

UPDATE: I wrote this last night and forgot to post it xD
----------

It was my first ever sales kickoff. The year doesn't really matter all that much, but I was younger and definitely not as driven or focused as I am now. I worked for, well lets call them "The Huge Company." (If you get the joke there, cheers.) I had flown in the evening before, hadn't slept well in the hotel and on top of that, Since I was on the service side, and not sales, I had to keep working and answering calls, emails, tickets that came in, while the sales folks (no shade) got to chill and vibe. CEO...President...CTO all of them roated on and off the platform, setting the stage for the next 4 quarters. Honestly, I don't remember what any of them said. It was full of numbers, sales targets, metrics and all kinds of figures, including the super awesome vacation that all the sales folks got to go on! (Ok, maybe a little shade on that one)

The one thing I remember was our guest speaker. He was a Marine (no such thing as former, right?) and he had been shot multiple times, including having his entire jaw shot off in the line of duty. [Lt. Col. Justin Constantine.](https://www.justinconstantine.com/) He spoke on Thriving in the face of change, Resilience and teamwork, leadership under pressure, asking for help, and recognizing inner strength. I still haven't forgot those different points even to this day. He spoke on these things in the form of a story. His story, which of course made it more personal, more real. And I remember even then thinking, "He could have just talked to us about these different ideas. He could have presented data, shown statistics, metrics that proved 'increased productivity and collaboration.'" But instead Lt. Col Justin just told his story, and that of his living and fallen brothers in arms.

All of that to say...in a sea of buzzwords, sales numbers, graphs, charts, goals and metrics shared by the CEO, the President, the CTO...those stories are what cut through. What stuck with me.

## So why did that stick?

I didn't have the language for it then, but I do now, thanks to my time spent in CTI. To be honest, lately I've been diving into "signal-to-noise" ratios. What do people remember? I'm trying to figure out, what makes messages land and stick.

**Stories land hard**
In fact, according to Stanford’s Dr. Jennifer Aaker, stories are up to 22 times more memorable than just facts. [Harnessing the power of Stories](https://cdn-media.leanin.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/HarnessingStories3.15.pdf)

And, if you're trying to persuade people...you should try to? Thats right, tell a story. [35% more persuasive?](https://www.inc.com/carmine-gallo/hard-data-shows-this-soft-skill-will-make-you-35-percent-more-persuasive.html)

Want to know how many people remember stats? About 5%. Know how many remember a story? **63%** [The Data Storytelling Process](https://ignaciochavarria.co/2022/09/08/the-data-storytelling-process/)

So what...if I want someones attention, if I want someone to act (CISO, Stakeholders, *that engineer you're begging to patch the thing that* **DESPERATELY NEEDS PATCHING** - you don't lead with a CVSS score...tell them what will happen if we ignore it. Show them examples (exploitation in the wild, WOO!)
We're not spreadsheets, we're walking, talking, pattern-recognition powerhouses, powered by narritive.

## What does our brain do with stories?

You ever notice how people lean in when someone starts with, “You wouldn’t believe what happened…”? That’s not random. When we hear facts, the language centers of our brain light up. When we hear stories? Sensory, emotional, and motor areas activate too. Your brain treats the story like experience.

Stories...No wonder we remember them. No wonder they move us. Lt. Col. Justin didn’t tell us about Huge Company’s mission — he showed us how those key points he made could help *build it out.*

## Why does this matter to me as a CTI Analyst?

Because we live in charts. We live in reports. We live in IOC reports and ATT&CK matrices and "RiskHeatGraphsThatNobodyReads.png."

But if we want people to listen, to care, to change behavior — we’ve got to speak human. That means stories.

Tell your SOC lead about what happened to the last company that ignored that lateral movement. Share the time your team caught a phishing domain just before a ransomware detonation — and what might’ve happened if they hadn’t.

Turn your data into narrative. Wrap your logic in emotion.

And listen, this has to apply to our presentations too. AI? Getting increasingly better at delivering data. Hell, AI can read data off a PowerPoint if you tell it to. You want to stand out? You want to make people remember you? Don't read bullet points in relation to data. Tell a *STORY* "Briefing with enthusiasm!"

Its almost 1am now, its *been* dark and that means I should probably go lay down, and toss and turn as I think about the current state of of the geopolitical climate. (see "Iranian/Israeli conflict" subsection "Primary Iraninan Intel Analyst" Paragraph "OMG")

But I really wanted to get this written down. Its no longer good enough to be a good analyst. You have to tell a story, and learn to wield a narrative.

Till next time, *May your caffeine be strong, your snacks be tasty, and your intel be a story*
