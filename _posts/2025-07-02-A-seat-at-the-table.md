## No One‚Äôs Saving You a Spot...at least not yet.

It‚Äôs late. Again. And I‚Äôm staring at the same screen I was staring at this morning, this afternoon, 10 minutes ago. But I‚Äôm thinking tonight about something no one tells you when you get into CTI, or cyber in general:

*No one is going to hand you a seat at the table.* You have to **build your own.**

-----------------------------

## When I realized this

Ok, ok. Maybe that sounds a bit drastic, but the idea is correct. In fact, I remember when I first got into CTI (hurray for contract positions becoming FTE!) a few years ago. And I remember thinking *"How do I get people to invite me to stuff?"* Or *"How can I make sure I'm included where I want to be, and where I think I should be"*

You see, what was happening was, I'd be grinding away at creating emails with (What I thought) was valuable reporting, digging up IOC's, even putting together some dashboards with my (then...still) limited knowledge of Splunk...

And then I'd watch as my work got skimmed. Or worse, ignored. (In reality it was good I was ignored for a little bit, cause I was like a brand new baby girrafe. I didn't know *WHAT* I was doing, stumbling all over the place.)

In reality, I was waiting -- *hoping* -- that someone would *notice* That someone would say *"Hey that was good work. Why don't you come joing us for this strategy session.*

Spoilers: They didn't.

### What I learned, (the hard way?)

üí°The people at the table aready have their seats. Most are not looking to be intentional about making room for you.

üí° Value is seen when you learn to speak their language, solve *their* problems, and in the process, make their lives easier. (Shout out to [Joshua C. Mason](https://www.mason-sc.com/book) for his amazing book [Speak Security With A Business Accent.](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=speak+cyber+with+a+business+accent&crid=RZIVSQOTNM1Q&sprefix=speak+cyber+%2Caps%2C126&ref=nb_sb_ss_p13n-pd-dpltr-ranker_1_12))

üí°Nobody **owes** you visibility. Nobody **owes** you respect. You **earn it** and you do that be delivering in ways that matter to them, not just you.

--------------------------------
### So...I started building my OWN Seat

I don't think that needs a whole lot of explanation at the moment, so instead I let you know what that looked like for me. I was talking anout the workdsnum
 I stopped waiting to be asked to contribute. I started sending short, actionable intel updates directly to stakeholders before they even thought to ask.

- I linked my work to their business pain. Not ‚Äúthreat actor X used technique Y‚Äù but ‚Äúif this actor succeeds, our key revenue-generating systems are at risk.‚Äù

- I briefed like I belonged. No apologizing for taking up time. No hiding behind caveats. Clear, crisp, direct and a healthy dash of charisma.

- I found opportunities to be visible. Internal brown-bags, tabletop exercises, incident response calls ‚Äî if there was a chance to show what CTI brings to the table, or even to learn more about other teams and show my interest, I was there.

- And, I became their problem-solver, not their problem-giver. Instead of dumping indicators on teams, I‚Äôd package it in terms of what action should be taken and why it matters. (Peep [this post](https://soupycyber.github.io/2025-06-23-On-story-telling-or-fact-sharing/)).

## A hard truth
If you want that seat, if you want to be taken seriously, be respected and be seen - you have to build it.

I mean, nobody is gonna invite you because you're 'nice', or because you worked long last week.

But, they'll invite you when your work consistently makes an impact. And when you make them need *you.*

------------------------------------
### Final Thought
I'm not there yet. And I've been at this for a few years now. I'm still building, and honestly I've a long way to go. But the process is started. I'm at the table, and I have a seat!

--------------------------
P.S. - I should add - the folks at my current job have been AMAZING. This is more a commentary on the intelligence process on *anything* else. If you're going into CTI - don't use this as an excuse to be a jerk, or morose.
