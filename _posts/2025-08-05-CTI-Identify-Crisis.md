## Cybersecurity...
*Its 11:15ish, and there is a cold cup of coffee next to me, and a kid starting to stir in the background, so lets be quick...*

Ever since I started working in IT almost 15 years ago, it was a dream of mine to work in Cybersecurity, in some capacity - *ANY* capacity. And now, *I'm here* and not only am I here, I work in CTI - which on paper (and in my estimation) is one of the coolest roles in Cybersecurity - (Right up there with Threat Hunting!)

And yet, to describe what I do to...many people - is difficult sometimes.

-----------------------
(Yes this really happened)
Picture this, I'm sitting with with a group of Cybersecurity individuals at a prestigious training event, we're going around introducing ourselves and saying what we work on/do...and it sounds something like this...

*"I built the products that protect our cloud perimeter internally."* and *"I manage a global team of pre-sales engineering."* and *"I lead our Internal Red Team operations."* I said, *"I do cyber threat intelligence."*

One of the individuals there squinted a little bit and said, *"Oh like, SOC support?"* The person next to them chimed in: *"Oh, do you make CTI feeds?"* and then somebody finally said it outloud, *"What is it Cyber Intelligence people actually do?"*

In that moment, I realized something. We don't even agree on the definition within our own industry.

--------------------

### Is CTI a role, without a role?

Some days, I feel like a **defender.**
I provide reporting or intelligence that helps harden the organizations posture, helps get ahead of potential threats, inform risks, maybe on a good day, even help prevent a breach with what I provide!

Other days, I am like a **detective...**
Pivoting on IOC's, chasing clusters of behavior, creating threat actor profiles to be shared out at large, and writing intel reports (case files!) like a digital homicide unit.

But SOME days, (and this needs to happen more I think) I'm a *storyteller.*
I translate off-the-wall threat data, obscure OSINT and highly detailed premium intelligence, into something that a human choice-maker can understand and then ultimately act on. No fluff. No fear-mongering...just signal.

But honestly try explaining all of that at a party (especially when people are describing their role in a single sentence.)

---------------------

### Identity Crisis....

The CTI field has grown rapidly, but not always in a clear direction or with a clear definition - and it shows.

- Some orgs lump us together with SOC, where we become (as I've heard it described before) "glorified IOC janitors."

- Others bolt us onto Incident Response (IR), like a walking talking reverse lookup tool.

- and still others, rarely, put us near the CISO, using us a a kind of "decision intelligence" - but thats rare.

All that said, this identity problem isn't just confusing or disheartening sometimes. Its dangerous. Because when leadership doesn't know what CTI is for, they'll underfund it, under uitilize it, or not pay attention to it, until its too late.

So...What are we? We're not just defenders, we don't patch systems or create YARA rules (although that last part is subject to change). We not just detectives, we don't hunt ALL APT's or run down OSINT feeds 24/7. And we're not just storytellers. Though I've spoken on the importance of telling a good story, if you want people to listen and act on your intel - you have to wrap it all in storytelling.

As best I can figure, CTI people are hybrids. Why? Cause we do a little bit of a lot of stuff...

- We defend by giving people early warning.
- We detect by finding patterns..sifting through the infinite noise.
- And, we (hopefully) tell stories that help get things DONE.

In many ways, we (should) be the bridge between "what might happen next?" And "what JUST happened?" and then "what should we do next?"

----------------------

My Point?

If you’re in CTI and feel like you don’t fully belong in red or blue, don’t panic.
You’re not broken — the role is. Or rather, it’s still being defined.

#### *So define it.*
- Show your value.
- Speak your findings in business terms.
- Build relationships with the SOC, the CISO, the IR team, the Red Team.
- Be flexible. Be curious. Be bold about what your role could be.

Because here’s the thing: **nobody’s going to hand you a perfect job description.**

You’ve got to write your own.

TL;DR (because I know how late it is):
CTI isn’t one thing. It’s a shapeshifter. The best analysts learn to defend, detect, and tell compelling, credible stories — because that’s how you move the needle. Even if the business doesn’t know what to call you.

Anyway, I’ve got to be up in six or seven hours. Thanks for coming to my TED-talk-that-no-one-asked-for. We’re not as alone as it feels. Till next time, *Stay Soupy, *Stay Cyber!*
